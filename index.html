    <p>
        The Fender Telecaster was the first mass-production solid-body electric guitar. Originally
        introduced in 1950, it was officially named the Telecaster in 1951 after the rising popularity
        of the television. It has been continuously manufactured ever since, and while there have been
        numerous versions and variations, the design has remained essentially the same.
